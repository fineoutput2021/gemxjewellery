      <p>I was born and raised in Jaipur, India. Jaipur is considered the hub of fashion jewellery and handcrafted Gemstones, and it's the best place to shop for the most elegant and sophisticated jewellery made from precious and semi-precious stones. I am an artist, traveller and designer by profession. Chole bhature makes me happy. I love dogs, theatre and pizza. I've always had a love of natural gemstones & has been attracted by colours, cuts and styles since childhood, so I decided to make my career in it.</p>

    line-height: 27px;" class="text-center">Founder and CEO, GemX, grew up surrounded by arts and objects from her parents' antiques business, an influential force that has guided her entrepreneurial spirit and eye for design. After graduating from art school in London, Monica immersed herself in the jewellery world and worked her way up before deciding to go it alone, creating bespoke pieces from her converted forge in Norfolk, with an office, showroom and workshop all under one roof. As the business has scaled, Norfolk remains at the heart of the design process, where she and her creative team develop all of the collections such as elegant earrings. Production takes place in India, where every stone is cut and faceted by hand from rough, using contemporary cuts, meaning your piece of GemX jewellery is entirely unique.</h4>
